## INSTRUCTIONS
Create a virtual environment with the command:
```commandline
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda --name snakemake snakemake=8.27.1 conda=24.7.1 snakedeploy
```
and activate it:
```commandline
conda activate snakemake
```
You can perform the pipeline deploy defining a directory `my_dest_dir` for analysis output and a pipeline tag for a specific version:
```bash
snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/massiddamt/miRA.git 
                    my_desd_dir 
                    --tag v1.0.2
```
To run the pipeline, go inside the deployed pipeline folder and use the command:
```bash
snakemake --use-conda -p --cores all
```
